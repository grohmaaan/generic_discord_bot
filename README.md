# generic_discord_bot
During the 2021-2022 period marked by the pandemic, I developed a Discord Bot using Discord.JS version 12. Although it may not incorporate the latest updates, I’ve chosen to release it as part of my portfolio. It’s my hope that others may find the code useful or inspiring for their own projects.
